## Hi there, I'm Joseph <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25">

I am a statistician, data scientist and an open-source contributor üõ†Ô∏è. I mainly write codes in R and Python, and trying to explore Julia sometimes. Most of my documentation is written in Quarto as I enjoy the flexibility of executing codes in a mix of text and it allows me to switch between python and R seamlessly!

Some of the things, I enjoy doing,

- Machine Learning
- Statistical Modeling
- Data Visualization
- Maps
- WebApps
